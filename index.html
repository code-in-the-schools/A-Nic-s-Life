      <h2> Nic's Life </h2>
<p> Hey, My name is Nicholas Green. I am 15 years old and live in Baltimore, Maryland. Throughout my life I have played several sports suffered several losses but to this day I still stand strong. When I was younger I would always wonder what it was like to work and now i actually will find out. I started playing football and basketball at the age of 9. My favorite hobbies are playing Basketball, Working out, and even reading books. During my free time I usually read books or play the game. My favorite series of books is called Diary Of A Wimpy Kid, which is a book a about a boy who is going into high school and is facing the point of growing up and he has a family that most of thetimeruins something. My favorite games consist of Madden, 2k, Fortnite, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, and Need For Speed. I attend Bard High School Early College and hope to retain my assocites degree from there by the endof high school. I also play shooting guard on the Varsity basketball team. My family in my household consits of Me(15), Brother(10), and my 2 sisters (1) and (20).
